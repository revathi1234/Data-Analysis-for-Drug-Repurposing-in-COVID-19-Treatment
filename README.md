# Project Report: Data Analysis for Drug Repurposing in COVID-19 Treatment
## Introduction

The outbreak of COVID-19 led to an urgent need for effective treatments due to the lack of specific medications. Drug repurposing emerged as a viable strategy to expedite treatment development by exploring existing drugs for potential use against the virus. Sentiment analysis, a branch of NLP, was employed to gauge the sentiment associated with drug mentions in COVID-19-related articles. Understanding the sentiment towards specific drugs is crucial in identifying candidates for repurposing, hence driving this analysis.

## Methodology

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
A curated dataset of COVID-19-related articles from reputable sources was collected.
Preprocessing involved cleaning, tokenization, and removing stop words to prepare the text for sentiment analysis.
Sentiment Analysis Techniques
Utilized sentiment analysis libraries including VADER and TextBlob for polarity scoring.
Developed custom sentiment analysis models using machine learning algorithms to enhance accuracy.
Results

## Sentiment Analysis Findings

Identified drugs with the most positive sentiments: [List of drugs].
Correlated sentiment scores with drug mentions to establish potential candidates for repurposing.
Challenges Faced

Ambiguity in sentiment interpretation due to contextual nuances.
Handling negations and sarcasm in sentiment analysis.
Discussion

The sentiment analysis revealed promising candidates for drug repurposing in COVID-19 treatment. However, the process encountered challenges in accurately gauging sentiment due to linguistic complexities. The contextual nature of sentiment and inherent biases in language posed hurdles in precise interpretation. Despite these challenges, the analysis presents a foundation for further investigation into repurposing existing drugs.

## Conclusion

The project successfully utilized sentiment analysis to gauge public sentiment towards various drugs mentioned in COVID-19-related articles. The findings highlight potential candidates for repurposing, offering a direction for further clinical research. Recommendations include refining sentiment analysis models to account for linguistic nuances and expanding the dataset for a more comprehensive analysis.
